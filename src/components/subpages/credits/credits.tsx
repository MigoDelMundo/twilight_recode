          <b>Credits</b>
          <br /> Credits to Programming with Mosh for initially teaching me how
          to program with React.js with his course. Highly recommend.
          <br /> Credits to ChatGPT for helping me with so much of the logic and
          errors that came up with the programming of this website. Helped me so
          much that it's insane.
          <br /> Credits to you as well for reading this part of the website
          haha thanks
          <br />
          <br /> I don't know what else to put so I want to shoutout some other
          people. <br />
          Shoutout to my dearest mom who bought me a new laptop which was
          basically where I spent a majority of my coding time in.
